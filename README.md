**Future Steps**

Overall CSS rehaul would be nice.
Adding a filter to choose which regions that you would like to guess from.
Difficulty modes: having a silhouette turn on and off, making the guess check less strict based on what mode you have selected
Leaderboards to compare with your friends.
Let me know if there is a feature you'd like to add!
